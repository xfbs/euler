# Problem 99: Largest exponential

![graphic](img099.gif)

Comparing two numbers written in index form like 211 and 37 is not
difficult, as any calculator would confirm that 211 = 2048 &lt; 37 =
2187. However, confirming that 632382518061 &gt; 519432525806 would be
much more difficult, as both numbers contain over three million digits.
Using base\_exp.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 22K
text file containing one thousand lines with a base/exponent pair on
each line, determine which line number has the greatest numerical value.
NOTE: The first two lines in the file represent the numbers in the
example given above.
